# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** June 1, 2023, 08:00 AM - June 1, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)  
**Impact:** The web application experienced a complete outage, preventing all users from accessing services. Users encountered error messages and were unable to use any features or content during the downtime.

## Timeline
- **08:00 AM:** Monitoring system triggered an alert due to a high number of server errors.
- **08:05 AM:** Engineering team received an on-call alert and began investigating.
- **08:10 AM:** Initial diagnostics started to determine the root cause of the outage.
- **09:00 AM:** Confirmed that the issue was not related to database or server infrastructure.
- **09:30 AM:** Focus shifted to application code and external API integrations.
- **10:30 AM:** Several potential causes were analyzed, including recent code deployments and third-party service disruptions.
- **11:00 AM:** The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team for further troubleshooting.
- **11:30 AM:** The issue was resolved by reverting a recent code change related to an API misconfiguration.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration introduced in a recent code deployment affecting an external API integration. This resulted in an error loop within the application, leading to cascading failures and the inability to process requests.

### Resolution
To resolve the issue, the engineering team identified the faulty code and promptly rolled it back to a stable version. This eliminated the misconfiguration, allowing the application to recover and resume normal functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements
- Strengthen the code review process, ensuring critical integrations undergo thorough scrutiny before deployment.
- Enhance testing and quality assurance by implementing rigorous integration testing for API interactions.
- Improve monitoring and alerting with more granular checks, particularly for API integration health, error rates, and response times.
- Document the incident and resolution in a centralized knowledge base for future reference.

### Action Items
- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive review of all API integrations and their configurations.
- [ ] Expand automated test coverage to include targeted API integration tests.
- [ ] Enhance monitoring to track API health and performance metrics.
- [ ] Schedule regular incident response training and drills to improve team preparedness.

By implementing these corrective actions, we aim to prevent similar incidents and enhance the system's overall resilience and stability.

## Conclusion
This web stack outage resulted from an API misconfiguration introduced in a recent deployment. Swift identification and rollback of the faulty code resolved the issue. Moving forward, the outlined measures will be enforced to strengthen system robustness and reliability, minimizing the likelihood of future disruptions.
