# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** June 1, 2023, 08:00 AM - June 1, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)  
**Impact:** The web application suffered a complete outage, rendering services inaccessible to all users. During this period, users encountered error messages and were unable to interact with any features or content.

## Timeline
- **08:00 AM:** Monitoring alerts signaled a surge in server errors.
- **08:05 AM:** The on-call engineering team was notified and began their investigation.
- **08:10 AM:** Initial diagnostics were conducted to pinpoint the cause of the outage.
- **09:00 AM:** Confirmed that the problem was unrelated to database or server infrastructure issues.
- **09:30 AM:** Debugging efforts shifted towards examining application code and external API dependencies.
- **10:30 AM:** Multiple potential causes were assessed, including recent code changes and third-party service failures.
- **11:00 AM:** The issue was escalated to senior engineers for further analysis.
- **11:30 AM:** Engineers resolved the problem by rolling back a recent deployment that contained an API misconfiguration.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
The outage stemmed from a misconfigured API integration introduced in a recent code update. This misconfiguration created an error loop within the application, ultimately leading to system-wide failure and an inability to process requests.


### Resolution
The engineering team identified the erroneous code and promptly rolled it back to a stable version. This rollback rectified the misconfiguration, allowing the application to restore normal functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Areas for Improvement
- Strengthen the code review workflow to ensure critical integrations undergo thorough validation before deployment.
- Enhance testing and quality assurance by implementing extensive integration testing for API interactions.
- Improve monitoring and alert systems to include detailed checks for API health, error rates, and response times.
- Document the incident and its resolution in a centralized knowledge repository for future reference.

### Action Plan
- [ ] Conduct an in-depth review of all API integrations and their configurations.
- [ ] Expand automated testing to cover targeted API interactions.
- [ ] Upgrade monitoring systems to track API performance and health indicators.
- [ ] Schedule routine incident response training to boost team efficiency in handling emergencies.

By implementing these corrective steps, we aim to prevent similar outages and reinforce the systemâ€™s resilience.

## Conclusion
This web stack failure was triggered by an API misconfiguration introduced in a recent deployment. Prompt detection and rollback of the problematic code led to the system's recovery. Moving forward, we will enforce the outlined measures to strengthen system stability and reduce the likelihood of future disruptions.
