### **Explanation of Infrastructure Components**
#### **1. What is a server?**
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services to other devices, such as hosting websites, storing data, or running applications.

#### **2. Role of the domain name**
The domain name `foobar.com` acts as a human-readable identifier, making it easier for users to access the server without remembering its IP address.

#### **3. Type of DNS record for `www` in `www.foobar.com`**
The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is a **CNAME** (Canonical Name) record pointing to an A record that resolves to the server IP `8.8.8.8`.

#### **4. Role of the web server**
The web server (Nginx):
   - Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
   - Serves static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Acts as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server.

#### **5. Role of the application server**
The application server:
   - Processes backend business logic (e.g., retrieving user data, processing forms).
   - Interfaces with the database for data storage and retrieval.

#### **6. Role of the database**
The database (MySQL):
   - Stores and organizes the data used by the application (e.g., user details, product information).
   - Provides efficient queries for reading/writing data.

#### **7. Communication with the user**
The server communicates with the userâ€™s browser using the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol**, transferring data packets over the internet.

### **Issues with the Infrastructure**
1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**:
   - If the server crashes, the entire website becomes unavailable.
2. **Downtime During Maintenance**:
   - Tasks like updating code or restarting the server will make the website temporarily inaccessible.
3. **Scalability Issues**:
   - The single server cannot handle a significant increase in traffic, leading to slow performance or outages.
